I got the biggest ever learning while solving the questions

❤️ learning: if array contains negative no then sliding window cant be applied

this question
862. Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K
link :https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-with-sum-at-least-k/
contains negative no too ...hence sliding window cant be applied in it

this contains only positive no
209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum
link :https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/description/
hence sliding window can be applied


the above two questions are exactly same.....the only difference is one contains +ve no only and the other -ve too
